a-void-game
===========

A meaningless game project. Developed with Java using Slick2D library.

#### Description

"A Void Game" is just like a classical "avoid the obstacles" kind of game
where the character which is controlled by the player, tries to avoid arrows
coming at him from every one of 4 sides of the screen. The actual thing of the
game is that after every level, some random effects influences the environment.
For example, "Winky" (player controlled character) may get bigger, or say, slower.
Speed or number of arrows may increase. This affects the game in different ways.
It may become easier, or may turn into a hard challenge. No matter what, the main
goal of the game is to endure as much as possible.

#### Trivial Information

* The name of the game implies that it has no story and it is only a casual game
which has no purpose at all. Also, "A Void" can be pronounced in the same way as "avoid"
which is one of the mechanics of the game.
* This game is coded for the sole purpose of getting better at Java and experimenting
with one of Java game libraries.
